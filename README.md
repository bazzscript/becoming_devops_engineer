## DevOps Learning Plan 2024

This is my DevOps learning plan/guide for the year 2024, it consists of both paid courses and mostly free courses, pick as you wish and create your learning plan from this.
A little inspiration from (https://github.com/hacktivist123/DevOps-Learning-Plan/), 

PS:
- Already have Multiple Years (2+) of Professional Backend Engineering Experience, so I already had substantial technical foundations, before I started (November 2023).
- Started my own DevOps journey (December 2023)
- I will add resources I find useful as i go along
- I am writing some articles and probably making some videos along the way, adding links as I make them
- ⏳ Means I am currently doing this. ✅ Means I have completed this.
